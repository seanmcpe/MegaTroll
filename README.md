Troll innocent or guilty players with commands!

-----

Leaving this as a community-type plugin that anyone may commit to. I'll accept any pull request as long as it works and is appropriate to the plugin. I'll still make commits to it, but having it as something where everyone can help out will make it all the better. At the time of creating it, there was no real "Troll" plugin for MCPE. I've created this in hopes of there now being.

If you have an idea for the plugin and cannot code, please Tweet me: @Sean_MCPE â€” I can code it for you. 



Thanks,

Sean
